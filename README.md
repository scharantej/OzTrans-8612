## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files
- **index.html:** The main page of the application. It will contain the form for entering flashcards and a button to submit them.
- **results.html:** This page will display the translated flashcards.

### Routes
- **/:** The root route, which will redirect to the index page.
- ** /flashcards:** This route will handle the submission of the flashcards. It will translate the flashcards and redirect to the results page.
- ** /results:** This route will display the translated flashcards.

### Application Structure

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/flashcards', methods=['POST'])
def flashcards():
    flashcards = request.form.getlist('flashcards')
    translated_flashcards = translate_flashcards(flashcards)
    return render_template('results.html', flashcards=translated_flashcards)

@app.route('/results')
def results():
    return render_template('results.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Additional Notes
- The `translate_flashcards` function is not implemented in the design, as it is assumed to be provided by an external library or a custom implementation.
- This application relies on the Bootstrap framework for styling. The necessary CSS and JavaScript files should be included in the HTML files.
- Error handling and input validation should be added to the application for robustness.
